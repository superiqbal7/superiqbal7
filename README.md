### Hi there 👋

I'm Iqbal, your friendly neighborhood 🥑 at Craftsmen. 😄

I am a software engineer with several years of experience and a background in competitive programming. JavaScript is my main language. I've been creating full-stack JavaScript software for the last few years. I started fiddling with distributed systems, DevOps and Cloud.

- 🔭 Currently working on a few open-source Node.js projects
- 🌱 Currently learning anything and everything about Node.js, DevOps, and Cloud
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on anything cool and fun in the open-source Node.js world and cloud native solutions
- 💬 Ask me about anything :smile:
